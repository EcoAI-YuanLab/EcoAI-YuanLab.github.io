### Welcome to EcoClimate AI Lab! 

ðŸ“¢ðŸ“¢**We are recruiting a PhD student and a postdoc!**  If you are interested in joining us, please **[click here](https://ecoai-yuanlab.github.io/teaching/)** for details, and contact Dr. Kunxiaojia (Tammy) Yuan at <a href="mailto:kyuan@central.uh.edu" class="email-link">kyuan@central.uh.edu</a> with your CV, transcript, and a brief statement of your research experience and interests.

### About the Lab

EcoClimate AI Lab is directed by Dr. Kunxiaojia (Tammy) Yuan, who is an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, at University of Houston](https://www.uh.edu/nsm/earth-atmospheric/). Previously, Tammy was a postdoc at the [Earth & Environmental Sciences Area, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory](https://eesa.lbl.gov/). 

We study how ecosystems respond to climate dynamics and disturbances (e.g., wildfire, deforestation, flooding) through carbon-water-energy nexus, with a particular focus on wetland and forest ecosystems. Our goal is to improve understanding of ecosystem health, assess ecosystem risks, and advance sustainable management and nature-based climate solutions. To achieve this, we use a range of tools, including advanced machine and deep learning, causal inference, Earth system models, remote sensing, and field measurements (e.g., eddy covariance, chambers, and isotopes).
