Shuo Chen is a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences at Purdue University](https://www.eaps.purdue.edu/). In 2024, she was supervised by Dr. Yuan during the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab student internship program. During her internship, she quantified the CH4 temperature hysteresis across 25 eddy-covariance sites from FLUXNET-CH4 and compared it against the estimates from 42 CH4 emission models, including 13 biogeochemical models, 22 atmospheric inversion models, and 7 machine learning models.

Working with Dr. Yuan, she published the paper ['Hysteretic temperature sensitivity in wetland CH4 emission modeling' ](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168192325003247) in Agricultural and Forest Meteorology, which is one of outcomes of the internship project.
