Benjamin Yan is a master's student in the [Department of Computer Science at Stanford University](https://www.cs.stanford.edu/). In 2024, he was supervised by Dr. Yuan during the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab student internship program. His research focuses on developing advanced AI models for predicting freshwater wetland CH₄ emissions and detecting the dominant drivers of CH4 dynamics  across different wetland types. 

His work resulted in an AGU poster entitled “Attention-Based Transformer Architectures for Multi-Site Global Wetland CH₄ Emissions Modeling and Identifying Key Ecosystem Drivers”.
