I am seeking a PhD student and a Postdoc to join my lab at Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, University of Houston. Our lab investigates ecosystem-climate interactions and their changes under disturbances (e.g., flood, wildfire, and land cover changes). Students and researchers interested in AI and environmental data science, remote sensing, land-atmosphere interaction, disturbance ecology, and climate sciences are welcome to apply. You will join a collaborative and interdisciplinary team, and have opportunities to work with our close collaborators in UH, Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, Stanford University, and UT Austin. 


#### PhD students

I am seeking a fully funded PhD student to join my lab, starting in Fall 2026. Potential research areas include but not limited: Land-atmosphere exchanges of carbon, water, and energy; coastal resilience, ecosystem health.


Preferred Qualifications:
<ul>
    <li>Deep curiosity in scientific inquiry and application with strong self-motivation</li>
    <li>Familiarity with Python and machine learning</li>
    <li>Master or bachelor degree in a relevant field, such as ecology, geography, environmental science, GIS, remote sensing, hydrology, engineering, computer science, data science, etc.</li>
</ul>

Prospective students should submit their application to the Graduate Program at the Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at University of Houston. Applicants must meet the admission requirements of the UH Graduate School. International students must also meet TOEFL/IELTS requirements. Prospective students are encouraged to contact Dr. Yuan directly before applying to UH.

Please contact me as soon as possible to be fully considered for full support (tuition waiver and salary) as RA.

#### Postdoc

We are seeking a postdoc with expertise in machine learning and remote sensing to join our project on monitoring and analysis of wetland ecological and hydrological dynamics, particularly their responses to extreme events (e.g., floods, wildfires).  
Start Date is flexible (earliest start available immediately). Annual appointment renewal contingent on performance. Salary is competitive and commensurate with experience.

Preferred qualifications:
<ul>
    <li>Strong background in remote sensing and machine learning</li>
<li>Good record of peer-reviewed papers</li>
<li>PhD in remote sensing, ecology, hydrology, GIS, computer science or a related field</li>
</ul>


#### How to apply
If you are interested, please email Dr. Yuan at kyuan@central.uh.edu with the following materials: (1) CV with contact information for 2-3 references. (2) A one-to-two-page cover letter outlining your research experience and your research interest.
