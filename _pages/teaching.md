We are recruiting a **fully funded Ph.D. student (Fall 2026)** and **a two-year Postdoctoral Scholar** to join the [EcoClimate AI Lab](https://ecoai-yuanlab.github.io/) in the [Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences](https://www.uh.edu/nsm/earth-atmospheric/index.php) at the [University of Houston](https://www.uh.edu/). Our lab investigates how ecosystems respond to climate dynamics and disturbances (e.g., wildfire, flooding, land-use and land-cover change) through the carbon-water-energy nexus, with a particular focus on wetlands and forests. Details about our research and open positions can be found on our lab website. Successful candidates will join a collaborative and interdisciplinary team, with opportunities to work closely with collaborators at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Stanford University, UT Austin, and beyond.
