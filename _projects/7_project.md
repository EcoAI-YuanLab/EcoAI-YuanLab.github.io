Wetlands are the largest natural source of methane (CH4), the second most important greenhouse gas, contributing approximately 20-30% of global emission-related radiative forcing. Wetlands can also be a major sink of carbon dioxide (CO2). However, our understanding of the underlying biogeochemical processes affecting wetland greenhouse gas dynamics remains limited. This knowledge gap leaves the net climatic impact of wetlands and their potential as nature-based solutions underexplored.  Therefore, I integrate field measurements, satellite observations, machine learning, causal inference, and biogeochemical models to quantify inland and coastal wetland CH4 and CO2 fluxes from regional to global scales. I also investigate how these fluxes respond to climate dynamics and human activities (e.g., restoration and management), aiming to improve our predictive understanding of wetland ecosystems and their role in nature-based solutions.â€‹
