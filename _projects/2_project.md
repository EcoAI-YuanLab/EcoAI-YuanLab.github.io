Coastal ecosystems play a vital role in protecting shorelines, sequestering carbon, filtering pollutants, and sustaining biodiversity, yet they are increasingly threatened by sea level rise, land-use change, pollution, and intensifying climate extremes. Although the restoration and management of these ecosystems hold great promise as nature-based solutions for climate mitigation and adaptation, major challenges remain due to limited understanding of their complex dynamics and the difficulty of monitoring processes that vary across space and time. Our research addresses these gaps by integrating field-based observations, remote sensing, and advanced modeling to investigate key aspects of coastal carbon–water–energy exchanges, biodiversity, and pollution dynamics, particularly under extreme disturbances such as flooding and hurricanes. Through this work, we seek to provide actionable insights that support the sustainable management and restoration of coastal ecosystems, ultimately advancing more effective nature-based solutions.
