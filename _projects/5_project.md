Wildfires are occurring with increasing frequency and severity worldwide, leading to escalating economic, ecological, and social losses. Yet despite their growing importance, current wildfire models remain limited in their ability to capture the full complexity of fire dynamics. Many critical processes—including vegetation flammability, fuel–climate interactions, human ignition patterns, and feedbacks between fire, atmosphere, and ecosystems—are still poorly represented in existing frameworks. Our research seeks to advance wildfire modeling by integrating process-based approaches with hybrid artificial intelligence models to improve predictions of fire occurrence, spread, and burn area at regional to global scales. In parallel, we are deeply interested in understanding the ecological consequences of wildfire, including carbon and nutrient cycling, habitat shifts, and biophysical feedbacks to the climate system. We also study post-fire ecosystem recovery, with particular focus on vegetation regrowth, soil stabilization, and hydrological responses. Together, this work aims to provide both mechanistic insights and actionable tools for anticipating wildfire risks and informing management strategies that foster resilience in coupled human–natural systems.
