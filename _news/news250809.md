On August 6-8, 2025, in Berkeley, CA, the workshop “Bridging the Gap: Flux Data Meets Land Surface Models”, supported by FLUXNET(NSF) was successfully completed, leaving participants eager for further collaborative projects integrating flux data with land surface models. The workshop was attended by 32 early-career scientists from 9 different countries, bringing together diverse perspectives. Over the course of three days, lectures were conducted by experts in the field of flux science and land surface modeling, along with hands-on tutorials to enhance understanding of the challenges associated with using flux data for model validation and parameterization.

#### Workshop activities

<ul>
    <li>Introduction to the fundamentals of eddy covariance measurements and flux data processing,and hands-on practice with REddyProc, including gap-filling and flux partitioning.</li>
    <li>Land surface modeling with a focus on the DOE’s Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) Land Model (ELM), including its structure and the workflow for running model simulations.</li>
    <li>Model–data integration through hands-on tutorials on running ELM in Docker and conducting model–flux data comparisons for evaluation and validation</li>
    <li> Foster community engagement and collaboration by providing opportunities to interact with experts, share research, and build connections between the flux and modeling communities.</li>
</ul>

The workshop organizing committee: Bailey Murphy (Oak Ridge National Laboratory), Theresia Yazbeck (Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry), Youmi Oh (NOAA Global Monitoring Laboratory), Kunxiaojia (Tammy) Yuan (Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory), Roel Ruzol (Howland Research Forest, University of Maine), Karem Meza Capcha (University of California Davis), Md (Mo) Shamsuzzaman (South East Technological University, Ireland), Yujie Liu (Northern Arizona University), Brian Wang (Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory), and Sreenath Paleri (Texas A&M).
