Our paper [“Hysteretic temperature sensitivity in wetland CH₄ emission modeling”](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0168192325003247) has been published in *Agricultural and Forest Meteorology*. Congratulations to first author Shuo Chen, whom I supervised through the student intern program at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL). This study is one of the outcomes of that program.
